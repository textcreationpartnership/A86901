            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian brethren and ſiſters, it is written in the 21. Chapter of the Revelation, verſ. 6. Chriſt Jeſus who is the perfect God, he ſaith plainly, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, I will give to him that is athirſt, of the fountain of the water of life freely.</hi> Which water of life I ſhall plainly prove ſignifieth the ſpirituall Word of God in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the new Teſtament, which proceedeth from the holy Unity, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. <hi>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Gooſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> In 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> Chap. 5. ver. 7. the Word ſignifieth Chriſt Jeſus, who is the ſecond perſon in unity, and I ſhall plainly prove that thoſe people that ſhall be reconciled to Chriſt by drinking freely of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, they ſhall be joyned to the holy Unity. My firſt proofe is in 2. <hi>Cori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the faith. Know ye not that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> How is Chriſt in his people, I ſay, by the venue and divine power of his Word, which is revealed in his glorious Goſpel. Again in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>What know you not that your body is the temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you, which ye have of God:</hi> and ye are not your own, for you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156366:3"/>are all bought with a price, even with the precious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, for this is he which came by water and blood, not by water onely, but by water and blood: 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. Therefore I ſay again, we are all bought with the precious water and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, therefore glorifie God in your bodies and in your ſpirits which are Gods. Again <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>There is one body, and one ſpirit, one Lord, one faith, one God and Father of all: who is above all, and in you all.</hi> Theſe phraſes of Scripture do plainly prove, that all thoſe people which are and ſhall be reconciled unto Chriſt, and to his glorious Goſpel, they ſhall be joyned to the glorious unity, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. Again I can prove that Chriſt and his Church is as man and wife; Chriſt is the Bridegroome, and the Church they are the Bride, ſo they ſhall be in number thouſands of thouſands: <hi>For a man ſhall leave fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother and be joyned to his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church, for we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. Therefore let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour to God, for the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Lambe is come, and his wife hath made her ſelf ready; his Miniſter hath made her ſelf ready, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>And to her was granted that ſhe ſhould be arayed in fine linen clean and white, for the fine linen is the righteouſneſſe of the Saints, which have their robes waſhed and made white in the blood of the Lambe.</hi> Revel. 7.14. Their robes ſignifieth the inward man of the hearts of the people which is waſhed and made white in the blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for if we walk in the light, as God our glorious Father is in the light, <hi>We have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> 1. Joh. 7. Thus I have ſhewed you in brief the true ſignification of the marriage of the Lambe. Now I come to my Text again, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will give to him that is athirſt of the fountain of the water of life freely,</hi> Joh. 4.13. Chriſt ſaid unto the woman which came to draw water out of Jacobs Well.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156366:3"/>
               <hi>He that drinketh of this water ſhall thirſt again, but whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt for the water that I ſhall give him will be in him a well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life.</hi> Which water of life plainly ſignifieth for to be the ſpirituall word of God. In the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt which ſhall ſpring and multiply in the hearts of the faithfull, that they ſhall be thorowly filled and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therewith. Again <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. Chriſt ſo loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of the water by the word, which is by the powerfull preaching of the Word. Again <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.21. <hi>And having a high Prieſt over the houſe of God, let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> Our bodies ſignifieth the inward man of the hearts of the people, which is waſhed, juſtified, and glorified by the divine power of the Word of God: for <hi>whom he cals, them he juſtifies; and whom he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, them he alſo glorifieth.</hi> Rom. 8.30. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay come: Chriſt and his Miniſtery ſay come, and let him that is athirſt come, and take the water of life freely.</hi> Freely I have received, and freely I declare it unto all the people that they may drink freely thereof, for to rain with Chriſt in glory for ever, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. Now on the other ſide, I will ſhew you in brief the true ſignification of the great <hi>Whore</hi> that ſitteth upon ſo many waters, with whom the Kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. Now I ſhall prove theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters muſt not be taken for temporall waters, which is to be diſdained with the bodily eye, for he ſaith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 15. verſe of the ſame chap. <hi>The waters which thou ſaweſt where the Whore ſitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations and tongues.</hi> Hereby I underſtand and prove, that this great Whore that ſits upon ſo many waters, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Devill, and all his carnall Miniſters, which have gathered to themſelves ſo many falſe and corruptible
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156366:4"/>doctrines. And as they have corrupted their own minds, ſo in like manner, they have blinded and corrupted the minds of the people, which are as yet held under their power. For upon her forehead was her name written, <hi>Myſtery, Babylon, the great Mother of Harlots, and all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the earth,</hi> Verſ. 5. Now I ſay againe, this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> muſt not be taken for atemporall building, for he ſaith plainly in the laſt verſe of the ſame chap. <hi>The woman which thou ſaweſt, the great whore which thou ſaweſt, is that great Citie, which raigneth over the Kings of the earth, for their Merchants were the great men of the earth,</hi> Revel. 18.23. which ſignifieth the carnall Miniſters of the earth; for by their falſiry all Nations were deceived, and by whom I my ſelfe once was deceived. This word <hi>ſawſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſignifieth ſo many falſe and corruptible doctrines, whereby the Devill and all his carnall Miniſters have blinded, and as it were bewitched the minds of the people, which are as yet held under their power. <hi>And a mightie Angel tooke up a ſtone like a great Milſtone, and caſt it into the Sea, ſaying, Thus with violence ſhall that great Citie Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon be throwne downe,</hi> Revel. 18.21. <hi>For by faith the walls of Jericho fell downe,</hi> Heb. 11.30. So by the ſound of the Trumpet, which is by the powerfull preaching of the Word of God in the doctrine of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the lively and juſtifying faith, ſhall ſound ſo powerfully againſt all falſe doctrine and falſe worſhip, which belongeth to the Devill and his Kingdome of darkneſſe, that the ſpirituall buildings of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall downe to the ground.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed you the ſignification of the water of life: againe, I have ſhewed you the ſignification of the great Whore that ſits upon ſo many waters, which I have proved doth ſignifie the Devill and all his carnall Miniſters, which have gathered to themſelves ſo many falſe and corruptible doctrines, which proceedeth from the wiſdome of the fleſh. But now I truſt in God, the waters of life, I meane the children of God, which ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156366:4"/>have a delight to drinke freely thereof, they will fight ſo powerfully againſt the devill and all his carnall Miniſters, that their helliſh power will be broken quite downe; for now I make no doubt but that ſaying will be brought to paſſe that is written in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the 15. chap, verſ. 54. <hi>Death ſhall be ſwallowed up into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, death ſhall be ſwallowed up of life; O death where is thy ſting, O grave where is thy victory,</hi> ſo thou, where now is thy victory; <hi>the ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law, but thankes be unto God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So I thanke God, he hath given me the victory through the vertue and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power of his Word in his glorious Goſpell, <hi>for the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law; Wherefore as by one man ſinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world;</hi> ſinne entred into <hi>Adam, and death by ſinne, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>By the offence of one, Judgement came upon all men to condemnation. Moreover, the Law entred that the offence might abound,</hi> verſ. 20. This word <hi>Moreover,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>moreover and above</hi> the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that the offence might abound, <hi>but where ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, grace did much more abound by one Jeſus Chriſt; for he was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed againe for our Justification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, thorow our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But the enemies and people ſay, that Chriſt hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us from the Ceremoniall Law: ſome againe ſay from the Judiciall Law; others ſay from the Leviticall Law; ſo they have divided the old Teſtament into two or three parts: but if I aske any of them, if there be any more then two Teſtaments, they will ſay no; then my anſwer to them againe is in the ninth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>For this cauſe Chriſt is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of the New Teſtament, that by meanes of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſion that were under the firſt Teſtament.</hi> This verſe of Scripture doth plainly prove of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156366:5"/>two Teſtaments. The firſt ſignifieth the old Law and Teſtament, which Chriſt hath redeemed us from, which I have proved to be unto death and condemnation. The ſecond is the miniſtration of the bloud of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which is the power of God to everlaſting life and juſtification; therefore being ſaved and juſtified freely by grace, we all have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle exhorteth ſaying, <hi>Let there be ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prayers for Kings and for all that are in authoritie,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. chap. Againe, he ſaith, <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admoniſhing one another in Pſalmes and ſpirituall ſongs.</hi> Hereby I plainly prove that godly prayers according to the true worſhip and honour of God, and <hi>David</hi> Pſalmes ſhall abide in the Church of Chriſt for ever. But for the old Law and Teſtament, which Chriſt hath redeemed us from, and the Common Service-Book, they muſt be laid aſide, for they doe not belong to the glorious body of Chriſt, which I can prove to be the glorious and triumphing Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the God of peace that brought againe from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepheard of the ſheepe, through the bloud of the everlaſting Covenant, make you all perfect to doe his will.</hi> He ſaith, the <hi>Great Shepheard of the ſheepe,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I acknowledge there is but one God, and there muſt and ſhall be but one Religion, one Shepheard, one Sheep-fold, and the meanes which God hath ordained to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sheep into one fold, is by the powerfull preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word, which is revealed in his Goſpell. And we know that the Sonne of God is come, and hath given us underſtanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true God, and eternall life, to whom be all praiſe, honour, glory, power, might, dominion and majeſtie, both now and evermore, world without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>
